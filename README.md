# Doubly-Linked List on TypeScript with console menu #

## This is one of my study projects where I've implemented Doubly-Linked List with all basic functions and menu for test ##

***By the way this console menu is ~~shit~~ fireðŸ”¥***

Full implementation with 20+ methods:
* Insert
      * by index (insertAt)
      * at the end (append)
      * at the start (prepend)
      * a list by index (insertListAt)
      * a list at the end (appendList)
      * a list at the start (prependList)
* Remove
      * list (removeAll)
      * by index (removeAt)
      * at the end (removeLast)
      * at the start (removeFirst)
* Search
      * for element (contains)
      * for a list (containsList)
* Other
      * get value from element (getValue)
      * get length of the list (getLength)
      * get node pointer (peek)
      * print list (printList)
      * copy list (copy)
      * swap 2 elements (swap)
      * reverse list (reverse)
      * return the first index where list occurs in another list (searchFirstEntry)
      * return the last index where list occurs in another list (searchLastEntry)
      * replace element in the list (replace)
      * check if list is empty (isEmpty)

## Changing type of list element ##

My implementation is not very good, the element is a Node, which contains number type of data. You can change it or make it template.
